# Model Card

## Model Description

**Input:** The model takes as input a dataset of smoking cessation interventions, where each row represents a study and contains the following columns:
- Study: Study identifier
- Design: Treatments compared in the study (A = no contact, B = self-help, C = individual counselling, D = group counselling)
- dA, nA, dB, nB, dC, nC, dD, nD: Number of observed events (d) and total number of participants (n) for each treatment arm
- hasA, hasB, hasC, hasD: Indicator variables for whether each treatment was included in the study

**Output:** The model outputs the following:
- Estimates of the relative effectiveness of each smoking cessation intervention compared to the reference intervention (no contact)
- Measures of inconsistency and heterogeneity in the network of studies
- Rankings of the interventions based on their estimated effectiveness

**Model Architecture:** The analysis employs a Bayesian network meta-analysis model, specifically the Lu-Ades model with random inconsistency effects. The model is implemented using the `gemtc` package in R, which uses Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for Bayesian inference. The model accounts for both heterogeneity between studies and inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence in the network.

## Performance

The performance of the model can be assessed using various metrics, such as:
- Deviance Information Criterion (DIC): A measure of model fit and complexity, where lower values indicate better fit.
- Posterior mean deviance: A measure of how well the model fits the observed data, where lower values indicate better fit.
- Consistency measures: Comparison of direct and indirect evidence for each treatment comparison, where larger differences indicate potential inconsistency.
- Probability of each treatment being the best: Estimated from the posterior distribution of treatment effects, providing a ranking of the interventions.

The model's performance was evaluated using the smoking cessation dataset described in the data sheet. The specific performance metrics obtained from the analysis should be reported here, along with any relevant graphs or tables.

## Limitations

Some potential limitations of the model include:
- The model assumes that the relative effects of the interventions are consistent across studies, which may not always hold in practice.
- The model relies on the availability and quality of the input data. Missing data, small sample sizes, or unobserved confounding factors can impact the reliability of the results.
- The model's estimates are subject to uncertainty, which should be carefully communicated and considered when interpreting the results.
- The model does not account for potential effect modifiers or covariates that may influence the relative effectiveness of the interventions.

## Trade-offs

Some trade-offs to consider when using this model:
- Increasing the complexity of the model (e.g., by including additional covariates or more complex network structures) may improve its ability to capture the underlying data generating process but may also increase the risk of overfitting and make the model more difficult to interpret.
- Using a more informative prior distribution for the model parameters may help stabilize the estimates, particularly when data is sparse, but may also introduce bias if the prior is misspecified.
- Conducting sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results to different model assumptions or data inputs can provide valuable insights but may also increase the computational burden and complexity of the analysis.
